    <p>Here is a simple guide for finding Luna Moths! This is mainly for fellow Connecticutians. Also disclaimer: these instructions were generated by ChatGPT and then cross-referenced with websites (most of them linked in "About").</p>
    <div class="how-to-container">
      <p>1. They are usually seen in spring and early summer months, from April to June depending on the local climate. They are also primarily active after dark so check after night.<br><br>
      2. They prefer hardwood forests and wooded areas, especially those with abundant foliage and trees such as oak, hickory, and birch. Look for them near trees, especially near lights or sources of light pollution.<br><br>
      3. Luna caterpillars feed on the leaves of various hardwood trees, including sweetgum, walnut, and hickory. Pay attention to these trees and leaves, as if there are caterpillars there, there will be moths soon.<br><br>
      4. They are mostly seen when they are searching for mates. Streetlights, porch lights, or other sources of light would attract them.<br><br>
      5. Remember that they are not easy to find. They are pretty rare and elusive and also only live for a week, so it will take a lot of patience and luck to find one in the wild.</p>

    <p>I wrote this page before summer so I don't know if I'll be able to find one, but I really hope I do! Unfortunately, I have no idea what type of trees my backyard contains so I'll just be blindly wandering with a flashlight and hoping I don't come across a bear.</p>
